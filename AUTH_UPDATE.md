# Authentication Update Required

## Issue Fixed: Draft Creation Permissions

The error you encountered was due to insufficient Gmail API scopes. The script was trying to create drafts but didn't have the necessary permissions.

## What Was Changed

1. **Updated Scopes**: Added `gmail.compose` scope to allow draft creation
2. **Removed Old Token**: Deleted the existing authentication token

## What You Need To Do

When you run the script next time, you'll need to re-authenticate:

1. **Run the script**: `python main.py`
2. **Browser will open**: Google OAuth consent screen will appear
3. **Grant permissions**: Click "Allow" for the new permissions including draft creation
4. **Continue normally**: The script will work with the new scheduling features

## New Permission

The script now requests permission to:
- ✅ Read your emails (existing)
- ✅ Send emails (existing) 
- ✅ **Create and manage drafts (NEW)**

This is safe and necessary for the Gmail-style scheduling feature where emails are created as drafts and scheduled for later delivery.

## Test Authentication (Optional)

You can test the new authentication by running:
```bash
python test_auth.py
```

This will verify that the new scopes work correctly before running the main script.
