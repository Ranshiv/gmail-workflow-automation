# ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: Create Drafts Only Feature

## 🎯 What You Requested
> "Instead of rescheduling and all that, can you please add the email to draft, i will reschedule myself. Make sure draft should included attached pdf file and body message properly"

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 📧 New "Create Drafts Only" Option
- **Added as Option 2** in the scheduling menu
- **Simplest approach**: Just creates drafts, no scheduling complexity
- **Full control**: You manually schedule each draft in Gmail when you want

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

1. **Updated Menu System**:
   ```
   1. Send immediately
   2. Create drafts only (you'll schedule in Gmail) ⭐ NEW
   3. Schedule delivery time (create drafts now, deliver later)
   4. Schedule script execution time (run script later)
   ```

2. **Enhanced Draft Creation**:
   - ✅ **Attachments included**: All PDF files and attachments are properly preserved
   - ✅ **Body message included**: Original email body + resend message
   - ✅ **Proper formatting**: Uses Gmail's draft API correctly
   - ✅ **Error handling**: Logs success/failure for each draft

3. **Updated Processing Logic**:
   - When Option 2 is chosen: `create_drafts_only=True`
   - Script creates drafts using `gmail_service.create_draft()`
   - No scheduling, no task creation, no complexity

### 🎁 Attachment & Content Preservation

The implementation ensures ALL content is preserved:

```python
# From message_handler.py - create_resend_message()
for attachment_info in original_data["attachments"]:
    if attachment_info["attachment_id"]:
        attachment_data = self.gmail_service.get_attachment(
            attachment_info["message_id"], attachment_info["attachment_id"]
        )
        if attachment_data:
            file_data = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(attachment_data["data"])
            part = MIMEBase("application", "octet-stream")
            part.set_payload(file_data)
            encoders.encode_base64(part)
            filename = attachment_info["filename"]
            part.add_header(
                "Content-Disposition",
                f'attachment; filename="{filename}"',
            )
            msg.attach(part)
```

**This means:**
- ✅ PDF attachments are downloaded and re-attached
- ✅ File names are preserved
- ✅ File content is properly encoded
- ✅ Original email body + resend message included
- ✅ Recipients and subjects are properly set
